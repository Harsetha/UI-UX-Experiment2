## Aim:

To design responsive mobile and web layouts for an existing digital product by applying Gestalt principles, UI patterns, usability guidelines, and branding techniques â€” ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Algorithm:

Step 1: Select an Existing Case Study

Choose a real-world app or website as a reference (e.g., Zomato, Uber, Flipkart). Understand the core purpose, target audience, and existing user flow.

Step 2: Apply Gestalt Principles

Study Gestalt principles such as proximity, similarity, continuity, closure, and figure-ground.Incorporate these principles into layout wireframes to enhance visual hierarchy and organization.

Step 3: Design UI Layouts 

Use a design tool like canva, Figma or Adobe XD to create mobile and web wireframes.Add common UI elements like navigation bars, buttons, input fields, modals, and cards.Follow responsive design best practices for different screen sizes.

Step 4: Integrate Interaction and Usability Features

Define and design interaction behaviors such as hover states, transitions, and feedback.Ensure usability by following principles like consistency, feedback, affordance, and accessibility.Simulate user journeys (e.g., onboarding, checkout, profile edit) in prototypes.
